## Abstract

Here is the report abstract!

My example dataset has `r xunits(nrow(dat))` rows in it and `r xunits(ncol(dat))` columns in it.`r paste0("^[", Footnotes.list$ExOfStandardFt,"]") ` That is `r pchange(start = nrow(dat), end = ncol(dat))`^[Here's another, free-written footnote!]. This work has nothing to do with [@RN170], but I'll cite it here anyway. I am sure that @RN621 would like to have something to say about that!

Note that references will appear at the bottom of this document (and any document that you put references in) but when you combine this document with all of the other documents that you create, it will shift to the bottom of the report.
