abstract = {PREMISE OF THE STUDY: Hybridization is an important mechanism of speciation in plants and often results in complexes that comprise multiple sexual diploids and their hybrid offspring. However, the intricacy of these systems has prevented a thorough understanding of many groups. The Crepidomanes minutum species complex (Hymenophyllaceae) is a widely distributed, morphologically variable fern species complex. Although prior reports of apogamy and polyploidy suggest hybridization, it has never been the focus of a phylogenetic study. METHODS: Morphology, nuclear (gapCp), and chloroplast (rbcL) DNA sequences, cytology, field observation, and spore counts were used to infer phylogeny and trace hybrid origins. KEY RESULTS: The C. minutum species complex is composed of at least three major clades: the African clade, clade 1 (East Asia and the Pacific), and clade 2 (Southeast Asia and the South Pacific). Clades 1 and 2 differ strikingly in morphological variation (uniform in clade 1 vs. highly variable in clade 2) and occurrence of hybrids (rare in clade 1 vs. frequent in clade 2). Apogamy and polyploidy were confirmed as likely mechanisms of hybrid stabilization in clade 2. Despite the large genetic distance between clades 1 and 2, several specimens were observed with gapCp sequences from both; diploid genome size and sexual reproduction indicate maintenance of genetic diversity via introgression or incomplete lineage sorting, rather than ongoing hybridization, in these specimens. CONCLUSIONS: The C. minutum species complex is a reticulate network including multiple diploid lineages and their stabilized hybrid crosses. Additional sampling focused on reproductive mode and ploidy level is needed to delimit diploid species and hybrids.},

abstract = {Ferns are the only major lineage of vascular plants that have nutritionally independent sporophyte (diploid) and gametophyte (haploid) life stages. However, the implications of this unique life cycle for fern community ecology have rarely been considered. To compare patterns of community structure between fern sporophytes and gametophytes, we conducted a survey of the ferns of the islands of Moorea and Tahiti (French Polynesia). We first constructed a DNA barcode library (plastid rbcL and trnH‐psbA) for the two island floras including 145 fern species. We then used these DNA barcodes to identify more than 1300 field‐collected gametophytes from 25 plots spanning an elevational gradient from 200 to 2000 m. We found that species richness of fern sporophytes conforms to the well‐known unimodal (i.e., mid‐elevation peak) pattern, reaching a maximum at {\~{}}1000–1200 m. Moreover, we found that fern sporophyte communities become increasingly phylogenetically clustered at high elevations. In contrast, species richness of fern gametophytes was consistent across sites, and gametophytes showed no correlation of phylogenetic community structure with elevation. Turnover of sporophyte and gametophyte communities was closely linked with elevation at shallow phylogenetic levels, but not at deeper nodes in the tree. Finally, we found several species for which gametophytes had broader ranges than sporophytes, including a vittarioid fern with abundant gametophytes but extremely rare sporophytes. Our study highlights the importance of including diverse life history stages in surveys of community structure, and has implications for the possible impacts of climate change on the distribution of fern diversity.},

abstract = {A new hybrid microsoroid fern, Microsorum × tohieaense (Microsorum commutatum × Microsorum membranifolium) from Moorea, French Polynesia is described based on morphology and molecular phylogenetic analysis. Microsorum × tohieaense can be distinguished from other French Polynesian Microsorum by the combination of sori that are distributed more or less in a single line between the costae and margins, apical pinna wider than lateral pinnae, and round rhizome scales with entire margins. Genetic evidence is also presented for the first time supporting the hybrid origin of Microsorum × maximum (Microsorum grossum × Microsorum punctatum), and possibly indicating a hybrid origin for the Hawaiian endemic Microsorum spectrum. The implications of hybridization for the taxonomy ofmicrosoroid ferns are discussed, and a key to the microsoroid ferns of the Society Islands is provided.},
